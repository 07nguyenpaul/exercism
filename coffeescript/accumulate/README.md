# Accumulate

Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of the input collection.

For example, given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

- square a number

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.

Elixir specific: it's perfectly fine to use `Enum.reduce` or
`Enumerable.reduce`.

Refer to the [Exercism help page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-coffeescript.html) for getting started with CoffeeScript.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called hello_world.spec.coffee, you can run the following command:
    jasmine-node --coffee hello_world.spec.coffee
